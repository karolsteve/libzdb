#ifndef CONNECTIONPOOL_INCLUDED
#define CONNECTIONPOOL_INCLUDED


/**
 * @brief A **ConnectionPool** represents a database connection pool.
 *
 * A connection pool can be used to get a connection to a database and
 * execute statements. This class opens a number of database
 * connections and allows callers to obtain and use a database connection in
 * a reentrant manner. Applications can instantiate as many ConnectionPool
 * objects as needed and against as many different database systems as needed.
 * The following diagram gives an overview of the library's components and
 * their method-associations:
 *
 * <center><img src="database.png" class="resp-img" style="width:700px"></center>
 *
 * The method ConnectionPool_getConnection() is used to obtain a new
 * connection from the pool. If there are no connections available, a new
 * connection is created and returned. If the pool has already handed out
 * *maxConnections* Connections, the next call to
 * ConnectionPool_getConnection() will return NULL. Use Connection_close()
 * to return a connection to the pool so it can be reused.
 *
 * A connection pool is created by default with 5 initial connections and
 * with 20 maximum connections. These values can be changed by the property
 * methods ConnectionPool_setInitialConnections() and
 * ConnectionPool_setMaxConnections().
 *
 * ## Supported database systems:
 *
 * This library may be built with support for many different database
 * systems. To test if a particular system is supported, use the method
 * Connection_isSupported().
 *
 * ## Life-cycle methods:
 *
 * Clients should call ConnectionPool_start() to establish the connection pool
 * against the database server before using the pool. To shutdown
 * connections from the database server, use ConnectionPool_stop(). Set
 * preferred properties *before* calling ConnectionPool_start(). Some
 * properties can also be changed dynamically after the pool was started, such as
 * changing the maximum number of connections or the number of initial connections.
 * Changing and tuning these properties at runtime is most useful if the pool was
 * started with a reaper-thread (see below) since the reaper dynamically changes the
 * size of the pool.
 *
 * ## Connection URL:
 *
 * The URL given to a Connection Pool at creation time specifies a database
 * connection in the standard URL format. The format of the connection URL
 * is defined as:
 *
 * <pre>
 * database://[user:password@][host][:port]/database[?propertyName1][=propertyValue1][&propertyName2][=propertyValue2]...
 * </pre>
 *
 * The property names `user` and `password` are always
 * recognized and specify how to log in to the database. Other properties
 * depend on the database server in question. Username and password can
 * alternatively be specified in the auth-part of the URL. If port number is
 * omitted, the default port number for the database server is used.
 *
 * ### MySQL:
 *
 * Here is an example of how to connect to a [MySQL](http://www.mysql.org/)
 * database server:
 *
 * ```
 * mysql://localhost:3306/test?user=root&password=swordfish
 * ```
 *
 * In this case, the username, `root` and password, `swordfish`
 * are specified as properties to the URL. An alternative is to
 * use the auth-part of the URL to specify authentication information:
 *
 * ```
 * mysql://root:swordfish@localhost:3306/test
 * ```
 *
 * See [mysql options](mysqloptions.html) for all properties that
 * can be set for a mysql connection URL.
 *
 * ### SQLite:
 *
 * For a [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/) database, the connection
 * URL should simply specify a database file, since a SQLite database
 * is just a file in the filesystem. SQLite uses
 * [pragma commands](http://sqlite.org/pragma.html) for
 * performance tuning and other special purpose database commands. Pragma
 * syntax in the form `name=value` can be added as properties
 * to the URL and will be set when the Connection is created. In addition
 * to pragmas, the following properties are supported:
 *
 * - `heap_limit=value` - Make SQLite auto-release unused memory
 *   if memory usage goes above the specified value [KB].
 * - `serialized=true` - Make SQLite switch to serialized mode
 *   if value is true, otherwise multi-thread mode is used (the default).
 * - `shared-cache=true` - Make SQLite use shared-cache if value is true
 *
 * A URL for connecting to a SQLite database might look like this (with recommended pragmas):
 *
 * ```
 * sqlite:///var/sqlite/test.db?synchronous=normal&foreign_keys=on&journal_mode=wal&temp_store=memory
 * ```
 *
 * ### PostgreSQL:
 *
 * The URL for connecting to a [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/)
 * database server might look like:
 *
 * ```
 * postgresql://localhost:5432/test?user=root&password=swordfish
 * ```
 *
 * As with the MySQL URL, the username and password are specified as
 * properties to the URL. Likewise, the auth-part of the URL can be used
 * instead to specify the username and the password:
 *
 * ```
 * postgresql://root:swordfish@localhost/test?use-ssl=true
 * ```
 *
 * In this example, we have also omitted the port number to the server, in
 * which case the default port number, *5432*, for PostgreSQL is used. In
 * addition, we have added an extra parameter to the URL, so connection to
 * the server is done over a secure SSL connection.
 *
 * See [postgresql options](postgresoptions.html) for all properties that
 * can be set for a postgresql connection URL.
 *
 * ### Oracle:
 *
 * The URL for connecting to an [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/)
 * database server might look like:
 *
 * ```
 * oracle://localhost:1521/servicename?user=scott&password=tiger
 * ```
 *
 * Instead of a database name, Oracle uses a service name which you
 * typically specify in a `tnsnames.ora` configuration file.
 * The auth-part of the URL can be used instead to specify the username
 * and the password as in the example below. Here we also specify that
 * we want to connect to Oracle with the SYSDBA role.
 *
 * ```
 * oracle://sys:password@localhost:1521/servicename?sysdba=true
 * ```
 *
 * See [oracle options](oracleoptions.html) for all properties that
 * can be set for an oracle connection URL.
 *
 * ## Example:
 *
 * To obtain a connection pool for a MySQL database, the code below can be
 * used. The exact same code can be used for PostgreSQL, SQLite and Oracle,
 * the only change needed is to modify the Connection URL. Here we connect
 * to the database test on localhost and start the pool with the default 5
 * initial connections.
 *
 * @code
 * URL_T url = URL_new("mysql://localhost/test?user=root&password=swordfish");
 * ConnectionPool_T pool = ConnectionPool_new(url);
 * ConnectionPool_start(pool);
 * //..
 * Connection_T con = ConnectionPool_getConnection(pool);
 * ResultSet_T result = Connection_executeQuery(con, "select id, name, photo from employee where salary>%d", anumber);
 * while (ResultSet_next(result))
 * {
 *      int id = ResultSet_getInt(result, 1);
 *      const char *name = ResultSet_getString(result, 2);
 *      int blobSize;
 *      const void *photo = ResultSet_getBlob(result, 3, &blobSize);
 *      // ...
 * }
 * Connection_close(con);
 * //..
 * ConnectionPool_free(&pool);
 * URL_free(&url);
 * @endcode
 *
 * ## Optimizing the pool size:
 *
 * The pool is designed to dynamically manage the number of active connections
 * based on usage patterns. A `reaper` thread is automatically started when the
 * pool is initialized, performing two functions:
 *
 * 1. Sweep through the pool at regular intervals (default every 60 seconds)
 *    to close connections that have been inactive for a specified time (default
 *    90 seconds).
 * 2. Perform periodic validation (ping test) on idle connections to ensure
 *    they remain valid and responsive.
 *
 * This dual functionality helps maintain the pool's health by removing stale
 * connections and verifying the validity of idle ones.
 *
 * Only inactive connections will be closed, and no more than the initial number
 * of connections the pool was started with are closed. The property method,
 * `ConnectionPool_setReaper()`, can be used to customize the reaper's sweep
 * interval or disable it entirely if needed.
 *
 * Clients can also call the method `ConnectionPool_reapConnections()` to prune
 * the pool directly if manual control is desired.
 *
 * The reaper thread is especially beneficial for pools maintaining TCP/IP
 * Connections.
 *
 * ## Realtime inspection:
 *
 * Three methods can be used to inspect the pool at runtime. The method
 * ConnectionPool_size() returns the number of connections in the pool, that is,
 * both active and inactive connections. The method ConnectionPool_active()
 * returns the number of active connections, i.e., those connections in
 * current use by your application. The method ConnectionPool_isFull() can
 * be used to check if the pool is full and unable to return a connection.
 *
 * *This ConnectionPool is thread-safe.*
