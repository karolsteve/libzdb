#ifndef CONNECTION_INCLUDED
#define CONNECTION_INCLUDED


/**
 * A **Connection** represents a connection to a SQL database system.
 *
 * Use a Connection to execute SQL statements. There are three ways to
 * execute statements: Connection_execute() is used to execute SQL
 * statements that do not return a result set. Such statements are INSERT,
 * UPDATE or DELETE. Connection_executeQuery() is used to execute a SQL
 * SELECT statement and return a result set. These methods can only handle
 * values which can be expressed as C-strings. If you need to handle binary
 * data, such as inserting a blob value into the database, use a
 * PreparedStatement object to execute the SQL statement. The factory method
 * Connection_prepareStatement() is used to obtain a PreparedStatement object.
 *
 * The method Connection_executeQuery() will return an empty ResultSet (not null)
 * if the SQL statement did not return any values. A ResultSet is valid until the
 * next call to Connection execute or until the Connection is returned
 * to the Connection Pool. If an error occurs during execution, an SQLException
 * is thrown.
 *
 * Any SQL statement that changes the database (basically, any SQL
 * command other than SELECT) will automatically start a transaction
 * if one is not already in effect. Automatically started transactions
 * are committed at the conclusion of the command.
 *
 * Transactions can also be started manually using
 * Connection_beginTransaction(). Such transactions usually persist
 * until the next call to Connection_commit() or Connection_rollback().
 * A transaction will also rollback if the database is closed or if an
 * error occurs. Nested transactions are not allowed.
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * ### Basic Query Execution
 * @code
 * Connection_T con = ConnectionPool_getConnection(pool);
 * if (con) {
 *     ResultSet_T result = Connection_executeQuery(con, "SELECT name, age FROM users WHERE id = %d", 1);
 *     if (ResultSet_next(result)) {
 *         const char* name = ResultSet_getString(result, 1);
 *         int age = ResultSet_getInt(result, 2);
 *         printf("Name: %s, Age: %d\n", name ? name : "N/A", age);
 *     }
 *     Connection_close(con);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * ### Transaction Example
 * @code
 * Connection_T con = NULL;
 * TRY
 * {
 *     con = ConnectionPool_getConnectionOrException(pool);
 *     Connection_beginTransaction(con);
 *     Connection_execute(con, "UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - %f WHERE id = %d", 100.0, 1);
 *     Connection_execute(con, "UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + %f WHERE id = %d", 100.0, 2);
 *     Connection_commit(con);
 *     printf("Transfer successful\n");
 * }
 * ELSE
 * {
 *     // The error message in Exception_frame.message specify the error that occured
 *     printf("Transfer failed: %s\n", Exception_frame.message);
 *
 *     // Connection_close() will automatically call Connection_rollback() if
 *     // the connection is in an uncommitted transaction
 * }
 * FINALLY
 * {
 *    if (con) Connection_close(con);
 * }
 * END_TRY;
 * @endcode
 *
 * ### Using PreparedStatement
 * @code
 * Connection_T con = ConnectionPool_getConnection(pool);
 * if (con) {
 *     const char *sql = "INSERT INTO logs (message, timestamp) VALUES (?, ?)";
 *     PreparedStatement_T stmt = Connection_prepareStatement(con, sql);
 *     PreparedStatement_setString(stmt, 1, "User logged in");
 *     PreparedStatement_setTimestamp(stmt, 2, time(NULL));
 *     PreparedStatement_execute(stmt);
 *     printf("Rows affected: %lld\n", PreparedStatement_rowsChanged(stmt));
 *     Connection_close(con);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * *A Connection is reentrant, but not thread-safe and should only be used
 * by one thread (at a time).*
 *
 * @note When Connection_close() is called on a Connection object, it is
 * automatically returned to the pool. If the connection is still in a
 * transaction at this point, the transaction will be automatically rolled
 * back. This ensures data integrity even when exceptions occur. It's
 * recommended to always call Connection_close() in a FINALLY block to
 * guarantee proper resource management and transaction handling. See the
 * Transaction Example above for a practical demonstration of this behavior.
 *
 * @see ResultSet.h PreparedStatement.h SQLException.h
